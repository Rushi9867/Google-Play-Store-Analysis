# Google App Store Project
## Problem statement 
Technology is the increasing need nowadays and used everywhere. One of the features of 
Technology is android. Which we all use in our daily life. Android is a mobile operating system 
based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed 
primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

## Introduction 
Google App Store Analysis is the project related to Exploratory data analysis(EDA)and Data visualization. I used python libraries to get App store information, visualize different aspects of it.In this project we 
are going to analyse some key features. For this purpose, we will get our data from shared drive 
ink. I did Extract-Transform-Load the dataset and find for me some information from this large 
data. This is form of data mining. All information can be achieved by mining this data found key 
metrices and factors and showed the meaningful relationships between attributes.
First extract dataset, prepared data, clean ,load and transform into Power BI desktop Then creating an interactive insightful dashboard and publish on novypro. To make prediction and better decision.
